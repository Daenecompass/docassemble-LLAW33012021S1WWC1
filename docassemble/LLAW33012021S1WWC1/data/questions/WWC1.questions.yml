# We put all the question block into this file.  We do 
# this simply to be organised.  We want to separate the
# actual questions we ask from the logic flow of the program
# itself (which is in the main file).  That way it makes
# the logic flow easier to identify as it's not
# cluttered with questions
#
# NOTE:  This file should not contain any mandatory
# question blocks
# checklist: name; consult with WWC; award known/unknown; type of employee; regular hours; hours per week; $ per hour; over time rates + award; penalty rates + award; allowances + award; public holiday rates + award; leave entitlement + leave owing; other + award if applicable.
